# Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I expect to graduate in 2025. My research interests are econometrics, applied macroeconomics, and high dimensional time series. In particular, I <b>explore econometric models, develop estimation methods, and derive statistical inference</b> to tackle questions on <b>dynamic causality and counterfactual analysis in macroeconomics</b>. You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_Wang.pdf).

## Research topics on theoretical Econometrics
* Vector Autoregression (VAR) and local/linear projection (LP)
* High dimensionality in time series

## Applications in Macroeconomics
* Dynamic causality: impulse response/Granger causality
* Counterfactual analysis and mediation analysis
* Casual transmission mechanism
