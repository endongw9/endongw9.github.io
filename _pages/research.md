* <b> “Counterfactual analysis in macroeconomics: theory and inference” </b> _sole author_, June 2024, 38 pages. (Job Market Paper) <br>
     <sub> This paper recasts two prominent macroeconomic counterfactuals—hypothetical trajectory and policy intervention—within the potential outcome time series framework. Our analysis demonstrates that policy intervention and hypothetical trajectory, respectively, correspond to direct and indirect dynamic causal effects, under the structural interpretation that hypothetical variable performance is the consequence of manipulating the corresponding policy shocks. We provide unique analytical solutions for the counterfactual parameters used in these exercises by employing a semiparametric structural model. Aligned with the empirical macroeconometric literature, we present a local projection-instrumental variable (LP-IV) based identification and estimation method for these parameters. The asymptotic theory for these parameter estimates is derived with two methods for covariance matrix estimation: the classic approach using an Heteroskedastic and Autocorrelation Consistent/Robust (HAC/HAR) estimate, and an innovative alternative using the Eicker–Huber–White Heteroskedastic Robust (HR) estimate, which remains valid regardless of serially correlated projection residuals. To address potential issues stemming from weak instruments, we present Anderson-Rubin type test-reversed confidence intervals. Utilizing high-frequency external instruments for monetary policy shocks (Gertler and Karadi, 2015), we (1) assess scenario analyses wherein interest rates follow a hypothetical trajectory in the post-pandemic era, and (2) scrutinize the macroeconomic aggregates' response to an inflation shock under the restriction of the central bank holding interest rates constant. This facilitates an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with central banks' efforts to tackle high inflation rates in the post-pandemic era through the manipulation of interest rate as a policy variable. </sub>
     

* <b>‘‘Simple robust two-stage estimation and inference for generalized impulse responses and multiple-horizon causality’’</b> with Jean-Marie Dufour (McGill University). Feb 2024, 96 pages. <br>
    <sub> We propose a two-stage estimation method for an h-horizon linear projection model and demonstrate that the two-stage estimates outperform the Least Squares estimates in two key aspects: (1) they are generally more efficient, and (2) they obviate the need for HAC standard errors. We apply this two-stage methodology to causality testing and find that the economic uncertainty index has both short-term (1-3 months) and long-term (30 months) causal effects on the economic activity index.</sub>
    
  
* <b> “Causal mechanism and mediation analysis for macroeconomics dynamics”  </b> with Jean-Marie Dufour (McGill University). Nov 2023, 30 pages. <br>
        _previous title “Intervention analysis, causality and generalized impulse responses in VAR models: theory and inference”_ <br>
       <sub> We investigate the causal mechanism in a dynamic model and propose an innovative index designed to offer a quantitative measure for the mediator during causal transmission. The study focuses on the counterfactual scenario where the causal coefficients from the mediator to the output variable are suppressed to zero. The empirical application examines the causal transmission from an inflation shock to GDP through FFR, labor, consumption, and investment.   </sub>

* <b> ‘‘Honest and Uniform Inference in High-Dimensional Linear Projections: An Application of Multi-Horizon Granger Causality and Network Connectedness’’</b> with Eugène  Dettaa (University of Montreal). <br> 
     <sub> We explore two types of de-sparsified estimates in a high-dimensional linear projection model and derive honest asymptotic Gaussian inference. Applying this methodology to Multi-horizon Granger causality tests, we establish network connectedness between large number of stock volatilities.

# Work in Progress

* <b> “Generic identification and practical specification for multivariate time series” </b> <br>
   <sub> This paper investigates the generic identification conditions for the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model and presents a practical specification algorithm. Our goal is to offer a flexible VARMA representation as a complement to the rigorous Echelon form. We apply this methodology to impulse response estimation, achieving narrower confidence bands compared to VAR estimation. </sub>

* <b> “The (mis)-identification and estimation of structural impulse responses in sub-space VAR model”</b> <br>
  <sub> This paper investigates the effects of impulse response misidentification and estimation under a sub-space VAR model employing Structural VAR (SVAR) and Local Projection (LP). We investigate the bias-variance trade-off between SVAR and LP impulse response estimates under a subspace VAR process. </sub>
