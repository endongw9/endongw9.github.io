# Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). <b>Later this year, I will join the University of Mannheim as an Assistant Professor of Theoretical Econometrics and Statistics.</b> My research interests are econometrics, applied macroeconomics, and high dimensional time series. In particular, I explore econometric models, develop estimation methods, and derive statistical inference</b> to tackle questions on dynamic causality and counterfactual analysis in macroeconomics. You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_Wang.pdf).

## Research topics in Econometrics
* Vector Autoregression (VAR) and local/linear projection (LP)
* High dimensionality in time series
* Dynamic causality: impulse response/Granger causality

## Research topics in Applied Macroeconomics (Monetary policy)
* Counterfactual analysis and mediation analysis
* Causal transmission mechanism
